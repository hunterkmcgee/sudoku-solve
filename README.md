By Hunter McGee, Bryce Taylor, and Matthew Wells

Python script to solve a 9x9 sodoku puzzle, using backtracking. Edit myBoard inside of solver.py to fit your puzzle and simply run solver.py.

## Current Successes:
* <b>solver.py</b> Implemented the solving algorithm
* <b>ex.py</b> Currently preprocesses image, extracts puzzle, segments puzzle to extract cells, and then feeds cells thru digit classifier model

## Necessary Packages:
* <b>OpenCV</b> 'pip install opencv-python'
* <b>Keras/TF</b> 'pip install keras'
* <b>Numpy</b> 'pip install numpy'

## Future Plans:
Improve digit classifier model
