# sudoku-solve
Python script to solve a 9x9 sodoku puzzle, using backtracking. Edit myBoard inside of solver.py to fit your puzzle and simply run solver.py.


## Current Successes:
* <b>solver.py</b> ) Implemented the solving algorithm
* <b>ex.py</b> ) Currently draws a green grid around the sudoku puzzle (if the image contains a puzzle). Edit image path inside of ex.py to change images.

## Future Plans:
To use OpenCV to extract a puzzle from an image and then detect the components of the puzzle, ultimately feeding the representation to solver.py
